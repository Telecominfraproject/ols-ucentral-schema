                Active means local switch posesses primary control responsibility

                Standby means that local switch is the redundant switch that monitors the Active peer, maintains synchronized state information and is ready to take over full control plane responsibility if the Active peer fails.

                The 'up' value shows the underlying session is fully setup.
                (peers can exchange keepalive messages - if configured, the synchronization is happening and the overall state of link is operational)
                The 'down' value means the logical session's status is <down> - potentially, peers can't establish a connection between each other;
                (either through a misconfiguration, a routing problem in the field, or due to keepalive messages not being received)
                The 'unknown' value means the state cannot be determined (no ports configured, remote peer issues etc)
