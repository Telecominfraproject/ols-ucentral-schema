          Disabled option - the poe-port's PSE is either disabled or PoE power is enabled
          but the PoE module does not have enough power available to supply the port's power needs.
          Fault option - the poe-port's PSE detects a problem with the Powered Device.
          Other Fault option - the PSE has detected an internal fault that prevents it from supplying power on that port.
