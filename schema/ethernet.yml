          Setting to <true> starts PoE hanshake

          Option to force device's PSE (Power sourcing equipment)

          This option can be used to reset PoE port without flickering
          it via <admin-mode> down/up sequence.

      detection:
        description:
          The detection mode is used to set the type of devices that are allowed for powering up.
          The PoE controller can be configured to detect only IEEE standard devices
          or pre-IEEE legacy devices (which were pre-standard - non-IEEE 802.3af compliant).
          For example, if "dot3af" is used (PoE, max up to 15.4 W), and Powered Device drains >15.4W,
          Power sourcing equipment won't allow this port to drain power.
        type: string
        examples:
          - "2pt-dot3af"
          - "2pt-dot3af+legacy"
          - "4pt-dot3af"
          - "4pt-dot3af+legacy"

      priority:
        description:
          Option to set priority to each PoE port. When the PoE switch has less power available
          and more ports are required to supply power, higher priority ports are receive power
          in preference to lower priority ports.
        type: string

        description:
          Configure PAE processing on port, as well as select this port as an Authenticator (configure PAC role to authenticator).
          force-authorized - Disables IEEE 802.1X authentication and causes the port to change to the authorized state without any authentication exchange required.
          The port sends and receives normal traffic without IEEE 802.1X-based authentication of the client.
          force-unauthorized - Causes the port to remain in the unauthorized state, ignoring all attempts by the supplicant to authenticate.
          The Device cannot provide authentication services to the supplicant through the port.
          auto - Enables IEEE 802.1X authentication and causes the port to begin in the unauthorized state, allowing only EAPOL frames to be sent and received through the port.
          The authentication process begins when the link state of the port changes from down to up or when an EAPOL-start frame is received. The Device requests the identity of the
          supplicant and begins relaying authentication messages between the supplicant and the authentication server.
          Each supplicant attempting to access the network is uniquely identified by the Device by using the supplicant MAC address.

          Multi-host — While in this mode, the first device to authenticate will open to the switchport so that all other devices can use the port. These other devices are not required to be authenticated independently.
          Single-host - While in this mode, the switchport will only allow a single host to be authenticated and to pass traffic at a time.
