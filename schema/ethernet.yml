          Power sourcing equipment won't allow this port to drain power.

          The authentication process begins when the link state of the port changes from down to up or when an EAPOL-start frame is received. The Device requests the identity of the
          supplicant and begins relaying authentication messages between the supplicant and the authentication server.
