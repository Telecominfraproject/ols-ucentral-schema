    properties:
      power-management:
        description:
          This configuration mode controls the power management algorithm used by the Power sourcing equipment to deliver
          power to the requesting PDs.
          "class" option - Class-based power management.
          "dynamic" option - Power management is done by the POE controller and the maximum power for a
          port is not reserved for each port.
          "static" option - The power deducted from the total power pool is the maximum power for that port.
          This mode ensures that the maximum power specified by you for the interface is always reserved and
          cannot be shared by other PDs.
        type: string
        examples:
          - "class"
